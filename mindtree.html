            <h2>Stocks Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Debt to Equity Ratio</h3>
            <p>The debt to equity ratio is a measure of a company’s financial health. It compares the amount of money a company owes (debt) to the amount of money invested by its owners (equity).</p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Importance:</strong> It helps investors understand how much risk a company is taking on.
            </div>
            <div class="ratio">
                <strong>Debt to Equity Ratio:</strong> <strong>0.10</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> If Mindtree has a total debt of ₹1,000 crore and total equity of ₹2,000 crore, the debt to equity ratio would be 0.5, meaning it has 50 paise of debt for every rupee of equity.
            </div>

            <h3>Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio</h3>
            <p>The P/E ratio measures how much investors are willing to pay for each rupee of a company’s earnings. It compares a company’s stock price to its earnings per share (EPS).</p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Importance:</strong> It helps investors determine if a stock is overvalued or undervalued.
            </div>
            <div class="ratio">
                <strong>Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</strong> <strong>30</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> If Mindtree’s stock price is ₹1,000 and its earnings per share (EPS) is ₹50, the P/E ratio would be 20, meaning investors are willing to pay ₹20 for every ₹1 of earnings.
            </div>

            <h3>Intrinsic Value</h3>
            <p>Intrinsic value is the true or fundamental value of an asset, based on its underlying characteristics and properties. It is different from the market price, which is influenced by supply and demand, investor sentiment, and other external factors.</p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Importance:</strong> It helps investors determine whether an asset is undervalued or overvalued.
            </div>
            <div class="ratio">
                <strong>Intrinsic Value:</strong> <strong>Rs. 3429.37</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> If you believe Mindtree can make Rs. 10,000 every year for the next few years, you can figure out its intrinsic value to see if it’s worth investing in.
            </div>

            <h3>Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)</h3>
            <p>The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is a measure of an investment’s annual growth rate over a specified period of time, assuming the profits are reinvested at the end of each period.</p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Importance:</strong> It gives investors an idea of the growth potential of an investment.
            </div>
            <div class="ratio">
                <strong>CAGR:</strong> <strong>42%</strong> (last three years)
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> If Mindtree’s revenue grew from ₹1,000 crore to ₹2,000 crore over 5 years, the CAGR would be approximately 14.87%.
            </div>

            <h3>Net Profit</h3>
            <p>Net profit is the amount of money a company has left after all its expenses are paid. It’s often referred to as the “bottom line” because it’s the final figure on an income statement.</p>
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Importance:</strong> It indicates the overall profitability of the company.
            </div>
            <div class="ratio">
                <strong>Net Profit:</strong> <strong>Rs. 4584 crore</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> If Mindtree earns ₹10,000 crore in revenue and has total expenses of ₹7,000 crore, the net profit would be ₹3,000 crore.
